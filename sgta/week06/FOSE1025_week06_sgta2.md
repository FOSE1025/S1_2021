# Week 6 SGTA 2 (Internal offering)

## Activity 1 - Importing CSV data to Excel Online (5 minutes + 5 minutes discussion)

The following URL points to a list of CSV files (Comma-Separated Value). We will use some of them in the lectures:

* https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html

Download the file "homes.csv" and open it using **Excel Online** (not the desktop app). Remember the process, as described in the lectures:

1. Upload the CSV file to OneDrive.
2. Double-click on the file. This will open Excel Online.
3. Enable editing and follow the prompts. This will save the file to the Excel format (.xlsx).

## Activity 2 - Writing Instructions (15 minutes + 10 minutes discussion)

Below is a list of tasks that you have learnt so far. The list is not exhaustive:

  1. Week 3: Filter data.
  2. Week 3: Sort data.
  3. Week 4: Validate data.
  4. Week 4: Look up at data using VLOOKUP.
  5. Week 5: Plot data.

Choose one of these tasks and write specific instructions that would help someone else complete the task.

Now, exchange your instructions with those of your peer and discuss how good they are for reproducibility. Are the instructions clear enough to help you complete the task?

## Participation task

Submit your assessment of your peer's instructions to the week 6 practical 2 participation task submission box. Once you have submitted it, show your submission to your tutor so that your participation can be recorded.

## OPTIONAL Activity 3 - Git and Github (10 minutes + 5 minutes discussion)

This activity is optional for those who have completed activities 1 and 2.

The lectures have mentioned git and github. These two are related but different technologies to manage software repositories and help collaboration. Answer the following questions by searching the web or based on your own experience:

1. What is the difference between git and github?
2. You can use git outside of github. Give an example of how you could do this.
3. While it could be possible to use github without using git, in practice, normally you would not want to do it. Explain why.
